            <h2> Present Perfect Simple</h2>
            <p>
                The present perfect is a verb tense used to express actions or events that
                have happened at an unspecified time before the present moment or have a
                connection to the present. It is formed by using the auxiliary verb "have"
                (in the present tense) followed by the past participle of the main verb.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some situations where the present perfect is commonly used:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Past actions with a present relevance: We use the present perfect to
                talk about past actions or experiences that have a connection to the present.
                For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "I have visited Paris." (implies that you have been to Paris at some point
                    in your life, and it is relevant to your present experiences or conversations)
                </li>
                <li>
                    "She has studied Spanish for five years." (indicates that she started studying
                    Spanish in the past and continues to do so in the present)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                2. Unspecified time in the past: When the exact time of an action is not mentioned
                or not important, the present perfect is used. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "They have seen that movie." (doesn't specify when they watched the movie)
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Have you ever eaten sushi?" (doesn't indicate a specific time in the past)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                3. Recent past actions: The present perfect is used to talk about actions that
                have happened in the recent past, especially when there is a result or consequence
                in the present. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "I have just finished my homework." (indicates you completed the homework recently)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The dog has chewed my shoe." (shows that the dog recently chewed the shoe, and it
                    still has an effect on the present situation)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                4. Actions that started in the past and continue to the present: The present perfect
                is used to describe actions that began in the past but are still ongoing. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "He has lived in New York for ten years." (indicates that he moved to New York ten
                    years ago and is still living there)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's important to note that the present perfect is not used with specific time
                expressions that refer to a completed period in the past (e.g., yesterday, last week).
                Instead, past simple tense is used in those cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember that the use of verb tenses can vary depending on the context and the
                specific language you are speaking or writing.
            </p>
